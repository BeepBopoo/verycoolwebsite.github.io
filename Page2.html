		<p>Hey! My name is Mohammed Khan. If you read my all about me you already know what my interests are and a few 
		details about myself. But now I am going to tell you more about myself and why I think I am an ideal candidate for 
		your program. </p>
		<br>
		<p>I have some interests which require a higher level of education. These interests are computer science and business.
		From my knowledge I know that this program is highly renowned and it has many great programs that can suit my 
		learning style and can help me grab my goals.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As you can see, I have a bit of experience in the coding field as the website you are reading this through, 
		was made by me. I am also a straight A student getting compliments from my teacher, principal, and outsiders as 
		well. I am going to start volunteering at my Karate dojo this summer so I can get a headstart for my volunteer hours 
		as I like to do things as quickly as I can, and not procrastinate.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I also think of myself as a great leader, partner, coworker, and a friend because I get to understand people's 
		needs and what I, myself can do to help them. I listen to their thoughts, feelings,  opinions and what they have to 
		say if they are feeling that they cannot speak freely. Secondly, I always want to be there for my friends and peers 
		as they will also have mine in times of need. I always think that when I am kind to someone I am being kind to myself
		and helping myself out.<p>
		<br>
		<p>Finally, I am a helpful friend who can inspire and motivate those around me and help my peers in their troubles. 
		I like to do everything the best I can and give it 110% effort and not procrastinate as it can hold me back. 
		I have a drive to be the greatest I can and would like to be in your high quality program. Thank you for reading 
		and have a great day.</p>
