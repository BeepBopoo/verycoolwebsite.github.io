			<p>Welcome to my original webpage! Down below you will find my "All About Me" and below that you will find out
			why I think I am an ideal candidate for the International Baccalaureate!</p>
		<h2>All About Me</h2>
			<p>Hey! Whats up?</p>
			<br>
			<p>My name is Mohammed Khan. I am in grade 8 and am graduating into highschool this year. I have a sibling who 
			is in grade 11 at VPCI. Her name is Safquat. I am from a South Asian country named Bangladesh. I have many 
			favourite colors but my top 3 are Cyan, Truqoise, and purple! I immigrated to canada in 2015 when i was only 4!
			Alot has changed since then and after you read this you will learn a little about me!<p>
			<br>
			<p>I like many sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball and more. I have many hobbies. My hobbies are Biking,
			Fishing, Drawing, and general playing. (Casual soccer, Board games, and such.)</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have many interests as well! My favorite is most likely Computer Science. This is because it is just so 
			fascinating! Everything is like a spiderweb .Everything is  linked together and just falls into place if what you 
			are doing is correct. I also really like building computers and watching people build them. My second favorite Is 
			probably Business. I like this field because it takes a lot of guts to be an entrepreneur. You have to try everything 
			until you get the right thing that you can do and if it doesn't work you have to keep on persevering until it does 
			which makes me feel like I always have something to keep me busy which is nice.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I also really like video games. I play A LOT of games but for your sake and mine, I will just name a few. 
			One of my favorites at the moment is Valorant. My second favorite is probably brawlhalla. Both are action packed and 
			are really fast paced. Hey, Thanks for reading about me! Catch ya on the flip side!</p>
